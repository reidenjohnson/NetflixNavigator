# Overview

As a software engineer, I am continually trying to improve my ability to work with real-world datasets and extract meaningful insights through code. This project explores the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset to better understand global content trends, including production countries, release years, genres, and actor appearances.

The dataset used in this analysis is the Netflix Titles Dataset from Kaggle, which includes information such as title, type, cast, release year, country, and genres.

The purpose of this software is to practice data cleaning, aggregation, and exploratory analysis using Python and Pandas, while building a reusable script that can be extended for deeper insights.

# Data Analysis Results

**1. Which countries produce the most Netflix content?**  
The United States leads by a significant margin, followed by India and the United Kingdom. This reflects major entertainment production hubs and Netflix’s strong partnerships in those regions.

**2. What is the average release year for Movies vs TV Shows?**  
TV Shows tend to be newer on average than Movies. This aligns with Netflix’s heavier investments in modern original series over the last decade.

**3. What are the top 10 most common genres on Netflix?**  
The platform is dominated by international content, dramas, comedies, and documentaries. These genres have broad global appeal and align with Netflix’s focus on internationally distributed titles.

**4. How many Netflix titles feature Adam Sandler, and what does that tell us?**  
Adam Sandler appears in a notable number of titles on Netflix, highlighting the platform’s ongoing partnership with him and the popularity of his projects. This also demonstrates how cast data can be used to analyze content trends tied to individual actors.

# Development Environment

This project was developed using:
- Python 3  
- Pandas library  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Kaggle's Netflix CSV

Python and Pandas were used for loading, cleaning, filtering, grouping, and analyzing the dataset.
